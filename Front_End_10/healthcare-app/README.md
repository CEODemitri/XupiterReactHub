My attempt to stand out from the plethora of coders. Weak attempt. One google search and there are many, more established sites. As a developer, philosopher and designer, I am all about unique solutions. If I invent a hammer, why must you find a way to invent the same design?
However, we are all studying the same thing: get a better career.

## Goal of Project

Take a simple design and make it functional on the Front End.
